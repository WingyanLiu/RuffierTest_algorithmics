# RuffierTest_algorithmics
The Ruffier test is a heart rate test that measures cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). It involves performing 30 squats in 45 seconds, and measuring heart rate before, immediately after, and one minute after the exercise. The test is used in physical education, sports medicine, and rehabilitation. 

The fitness result is dependent on the age of the test-taker. This test is for anyone above the age of 7.
